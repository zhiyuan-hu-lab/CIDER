# Why Evaluate Integration?

Single-cell RNA-seq integration methods aim to remove technical batch
effects while preserving biological variation. **CIDER** provides a
**ground-truth-free** approach to:

1.  Identify well-integrated cell populations
2.  Detect potentially incorrect integrations
3.  Quantify integration confidence through empirical p-values

This vignette focuses how showing the process using the example data of
dendritic cells.

# Set up

Apart from **CIDER**, the following packages also need to be loaded:

```{r setup}
library(CIDER)
library(Seurat)
library(cowplot)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Load dendritic data

The example data can be downloaded from
<https://figshare.com/s/d5474749ca8c711cc205>. This dataset contains
26593 genes and 564 cells across 2 batches.

```{r}
load("../data/dendritic.rda")
dendritic <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = dendritic@assays$RNA@counts, meta.data = dendritic@meta.data)
```

```{r}
# Verify batch composition
table(dendritic$Batch)
```

# Perform integration with Seurat

First an integration method$^1$ is applied on the dendritic data. You
can apply other integration methods to the your data, as long as the
correct PCs are stored in your Seurat object, i.e.
`Reductions(seu.integrated, "pca")` or `seu.integrated@reductions$pca`.

```{r integration}
seu.list <- SplitObject(dendritic, split.by = "Batch")
for (i in 1:length(seu.list)) {
  seu.list[[i]] <- NormalizeData(seu.list[[i]], verbose = FALSE)
  seu.list[[i]] <- FindVariableFeatures(seu.list[[i]], 
                                        selection.method = "vst", 
                                        nfeatures = 1000, verbose = FALSE)
}
seu.anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = seu.list, 
                                      dims = 1:15, verbose = FALSE)
seu.integrated <- IntegrateData(anchorset = seu.anchors, 
                                dims = 1:15, verbose = FALSE)

DefaultAssay(seu.integrated) <- "integrated"
seu.integrated <- ScaleData(seu.integrated, verbose = FALSE)
seu.integrated <- RunPCA(seu.integrated, verbose = FALSE)
seu.integrated <- RunTSNE(seu.integrated, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:5)
```

Clear the intermediate outcome.

```{r}
rm(seu.list, seu.anchors)
gc()
```

# CIDER Evaluation Workflow

CIDER evaluates integration results in three steps.

## Step 1: Density-Based Clustering

Clustering based on the corrected PCs (`hdbscan.seurat`). This step uses
HDBSCAN, which is a density-based clustering algorithm$^2$. The
clustering results are stored in `seu.integrated$dbscan_cluster`.
Clusters are further divided into batch-specific clusters by
concatenating dbscan_cluster and batch, stored in
`seu.integrated$initial_cluster`.

```{r}
seu.integrated <- hdbscan.seurat(seu.integrated)
```

## Step 2: Calculate Cluster Similarities

Compute IDER-based similarity matrix (`getIDEr`) among the
batch-specific initial clusters. If multiple CPUs are availble, you can
set `use.parallel = TRUE` and `n.cores` to the number of available cores
to speed it up.

```{r}
ider <- getIDEr(seu.integrated, use.parallel = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
```

## Step 3: Compute Integration Confidence

Assign the similarity and estimate empirical p values (`estimateProb`)
for the correctness of integration. High similarity values and low p
values indicate that the cell are similar to the surrounding cells and
likely integrated correctly.

```{r}
seu.integrated <- estimateProb(seu.integrated, ider)
```

# Visual Evaluation

## Evaluation scores

The evaluation scores can be viewed by the `scatterPlot` as below. As
shown cells with dbscan_cluster of 2 and 3 have low regional similarity
and high empirical p values, suggesting that they can be incorrectly
integrated.

```{r, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=7}
p1 <- scatterPlot(seu.integrated, "tsne", "dbscan_cluster")
p2 <- scatterPlot(seu.integrated, "tsne", colour.by = "similarity") + labs(fill = "Similarity")
p3 <- scatterPlot(seu.integrated, "tsne", colour.by = "pvalue") + labs(fill = "Prob of \nrejection")
plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
```

**Interpretation Guide:**

✅ **High similarity** + **Low p-value**: Well-integrated regions

❌ **Low similarity** + **High p-value**: Potential integration errors

## The IDER-based Similarity Network

To have more insight, we can view the IDER-based similarity matrix by
functions `plotNetwork` or `plotHeatmap`. Both of them require the input
of a Seurat object and the output of `getIDEr`. In this example,
1_Batch1 and 1_Batch2 as well as 4_Batch1 and 4_Batch2 have high
similarity.

`plotNetwork` generates a graph where vertexes are initial clusters and
edge widths are similarity values. The parameter `weight.factor`
controls the scale of edge widths; larger `weight.factor` will give
bolder edges proportionally.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plotNetwork(seu.integrated, ider, weight.factor = 3)
```

## Cluster Similarity Heatmap

`plotHeatmap` generates a heatmap where each cell is coloured and
labeled by the similarity values.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plotHeatmap(seu.integrated, ider)
```

# Validation Against Ground Truth Annotation

So far the evaluation have completed and CIDER has not used the ground
truth at all!

Let's peep at the ground truth before the closure of this vignette. As
shown in the figure below, the clusters having low IDER-based similarity
and high p values actually have at least two populations (CD1C and
CD141), verifying that CIDER spots the wrongly integrated cells.

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
scatterPlot(seu.integrated, "tsne", colour.by = "Group") + labs(fill = "Group\n (ground truth)")
```

# Best Practices

1.  Parameter Tuning:

-   Adjust `hdbscan.seurat` parameters if initial clustering is too
    granular
-   Modify `cutree.h` in `estimateProb` to change confidence thresholds

2.  Interpretation Tips:

-   Always validate suspicious joint clusters with marker genes

3.  Scalability:

-   For large datasets (\>10k cells), enable parallel processing with
    `use.parallel=TRUE`

# Reproducibility

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
